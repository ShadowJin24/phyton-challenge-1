# python-challenge-1
This challenge is to create a food truck menu ordering system. The menu items
were pre-populated. Code was written to ask customer to select from 4 of food
types. Then within a food type, customer is asked again what item they would
like to order. Next the customer is asked a quantity of the item they chose.
Customer is then asked if they would like order anything else and the ordering
system repeats if the answer is yes. If no, the each of the items selected are
multiplied by the quantity and then all are sum together. The selected items,
prices, and quantities are printed out and then a print out of the total of 
everything that is ordered.
